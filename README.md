Scripts used in the paper Persistent entropy detects topological structure in functional brain networks

Script comparation_of_pers_ent.py contains the code to produce the plots in the paper that compare persistent entropy. 
Original matrices are available in https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21941681. However, the python scripts can be
used with any set of matrices corresponding to adjacency matrices of undirected weighted graphs.
